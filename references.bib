Abstract = {{A biphasic continuum model is proposed for the modeling of a family of
   forming processes for fiber composites. The processes considered involve
   deformation of a fiber bundle network, wetting by penetration of resin
   into fiber bundles, and resin flow through the fiber bundle network. The
   continuum model represents three (or more) actual micro constituents as
   two continuous phases: a solid phase being the fiber network plus any
   extra void within the fiber bundles and a fluid phase being the liquid
   matrix. The model framework thus comprises the continuum formulation of
   a nonlinear compressible porous solid saturated with an incompressible
   fluid phase. Guided by the entropy inequality, we specify constitutive
   relations concerning three different mechanisms pertinent to the forming
   process: effective stress response of the fiber bundle network,
   compaction of the solid phase, and Darcian interaction between the two
   phases. We are particularly concerned with the compaction of the
   fiber-bundles of the solid phase, consisting of elastic packing combined
   with a viscous wetting process driven by the fluid pressure. The paper
   is concluded with a couple of numerical examples, where the volumetric
   deformation-pressure response of a fluid saturated fiber bundle network
   at undrained conditions is considered. Both volumetric relaxation and
   volumetric creep tests are analyzed. In particular, the response for
   different loading rates is assessed. As a final example, a finite
   element analysis of a relaxation test for the macroscopically undrained
   compression of a fluid-filled fibernetwork specimen is carried out. (C)
